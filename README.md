# NYC Property Sales Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the selling prices of properties in New York City using data science and machine learning techniques. Understanding property sales is critical for real estate stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and investors. By leveraging data science approaches, we aim to develop predictive models that can help forecast property prices accurately.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately forecast the selling price of future properties in NYC. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and analyzing relevant features, we aim to provide valuable insights for real estate professionals to make informed decisions.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [NYC Property Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/nyc-property-sales/data). It includes various attributes such as borough, neighborhood, building class, tax class, sale price, and sale date.

## Hypothesis and Research Interests
### Hypothesis:
- Properties in certain boroughs may have significantly higher or lower selling prices.
- Building class and tax class may influence the selling price.
- The year built and total units in a building could be predictive of property value.

### Research Interests:
- Explore the impact of location (borough and neighborhood) on property prices.
- Investigate the correlation between building class/tax class and selling price.
- Analyze the role of property characteristics (e.g., land square feet, gross square feet) in predicting selling price.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant columns.
- Encoded categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques.
- Handled missing or inconsistent data.
- Normalized/standardized numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the distribution of key features such as sale price, building class, and neighborhood.
- Explored relationships between variables.
- Investigated outliers and data anomalies.

## Model Development
- Utilized machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Experimented with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly.express
